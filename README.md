My Aptech Semester 4 project "Lab Pathology Management System"
### The Story
Life Line is a pathology lab which performs different types of test. Earlier the lab use to perform selected test only but with the increasing response of the patient and doctor demand they have added new tests. So it becomes difficult to manage the reports of the patients and the details of the various tests. So the management of the lab decided to develop software for the lab management. So the software Pathology Lab MANAGEMENT SYSTEM was developed to automate the lab details. This includes information about all lab items, Doctors, patients, and employees. This system gives a generalized, concise and accurate information regarding billing, purchase details. Stock etc. This system provides any type of enquiry such as patient details, stock, purchase details, Patient details, billing etc.
